# Plant Tracker API

Create a Plant Tracker app, that will allow us to track when plants need to be watered, when they were last watered, who is responsible for the next watering. It will also contain interesting information about the plant’s needs/origins.

## Names and versions of libraries used

### Tools

- JavaSE 17

## MVP
* Create `Plant` model with following properties and getters and setters for each one:
	* 	`id`
	*  `name`
	*  `priority`
	*  `lasWatered`
	*  `country`
	*  `duties`
	*  `intervalBetweenWatering`
*  Create `Country` model with following properties and getters and setters for each one:
	* `id`
	* `name`
	* `climate` is of enummeration type `Climate` with following values
		* `TROPICAL`
		* `DRY`
		* `TEMPERATE`
		* `CONTINENTAL`
		* `POLAR`
	* `plants`
	
	> `Climate` enumeration uses instance of`Condition` class as a value. 
	
*  Create `Duty` model with following properties and getters and setters for each one:
	*  `id`
	*  `plant`
	*  `person`
*  Create `Person` model with following properties and getters and setters for each one:
	*  `id`
	*  `name`
	*  `duties`

* Create `PlantService` in services package with following methods:
	* `provideInstruction(long): String`
	* `waterPlant(long): Plant`
	* `plantInformation(long): String`
	* `addNewPlant(PlantDTO): Plant `
	* `getPlantById(long): Optional<Plant>`
	* `updatePlantPartial(long, Map< String, String>): Plant`
	* `updatePlantFull(Long, PlantDTO): Plant`
	* `deletePlant(long): void`
* Create `CountryService` in services package with following methods:
	* `addNewCountry(CountryDTO): Country`
	* `getCountryById(long): Optional<Country>`
	* `getAllCountries(void): List<Country>`
	* `updateCountryName(long, String): Country`
	* `updateCountryClimate(long, Climate): Country`
	* `fullUpdateCountry(CountryDTO, long): Country`
	* `deleteCountry(long): void`
	* `deletePlantFromCountry(long): void`
* Create `DutyService` in services package with following methods:
	* `addNewDuty(DutyDTO): Duty`
	* `getAllDuties(void): List<Duty>`
	* `getDutyById(long): Optional<Duty>`
	* `updateDutyPlant(long, long): Duty`
	* `updateDutyPerson(long, long): Duty`
	* `updateDutyFull(long, long, long): Duty`
	* `deleteDuty(long): void`
* Create `PersonService` in service package with following methods:
	* `addNewPerson(String): Person `
	* `getPersonById(long): Optional<Person>`
	* ` getAllPeople(void): List<Person>`
	* `updatePerson(long, String): Person`
	* `deletePerson(long): void`
* Create `PersonRepository`, `PlantRepository`, `CountryRepository` and `DutyRepository` in repositories package.


* Create `PersonController`, `PlantController`, `CountryController` and `DutyController` in controllers package. Each controller must contain the routes displayed in the **Routes table** above.
	
	

## Extension

* Add a feature to display countdown time ie. the number of days until next watering date.
	* `getCountdownTime(long): String`
* Refactor `DutyService` and `DutyController` to prevent adding duty if a person or a plant already exist in a duties table. Following methods for `DutyService`:
	* `personExists(long): boolean`
	* `plantExists(long): boolean`

> `DutyRepository` should contain following derived queries:
> 
> 	* `findAllByPersonId(Long): List<Duty>` 
> 	* `findAllByPlantId(Long): List<Duty>`
